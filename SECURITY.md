# Security Policy

## Security Architecture

Curlino is designed with **privacy and security by design** principles:

### üîí Offline-First Architecture
- **Zero Data Collection**: Curlino does not collect, store, or transmit any user data to external servers
- **Local Storage Only**: All requests, groups, environments, and settings are stored locally on your machine
- **No Analytics**: No telemetry, usage tracking, or analytics are collected
- **No Cloud Sync**: All data remains on your device - we never see your API keys, requests, or responses

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Strict CSP implementation prevents XSS attacks
- **Context Isolation**: Electron context isolation ensures secure IPC communication
- **Sandboxed Renderer**: Renderer processes are sandboxed for additional security
- **No Remote Code Execution**: Application does not execute remote or dynamic code
- **Secure Defaults**: SSL/TLS verification enabled by default

### üìã Data Handling
- **API Keys**: Stored locally, never transmitted to Curlino servers (we don't have any)
- **Request History**: Kept locally, user-controlled retention settings
- **Environment Variables**: Stored in local application data directory
- **Settings**: All preferences stored locally using Electron's secure storage
