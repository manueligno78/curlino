## Logging System

The application includes a comprehensive structured logging system for monitoring and debugging.

### Log Levels

The application supports four log levels:

- **ERROR**: Critical errors that may cause the application to malfunction
- **WARN**: Warning messages for potential issues
- **INFO**: General information about application operations
- **DEBUG**: Detailed debugging information (only shown in development)

By default:

- **Development mode**: Shows all logs (DEBUG level and above)
- **Production mode**: Shows INFO level and above (hides DEBUG logs)

### Reading Logs

Logs are displayed in the browser's developer console with the following format:

```
2025-07-31T14:39:44.173Z [ERROR] [ComponentName]: Error message {"context":"data"}
```

Each log entry includes:

- **Timestamp**: ISO 8601 format timestamp
- **Level**: Log level in brackets (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- **Component**: The application component that generated the log
- **Message**: Human-readable description of the event
- **Context**: Additional structured data (JSON format)

### Changing Log Level

To change the log level at runtime, open the browser's developer console and use:

```javascript
// Set to show only errors and warnings
window.logger?.setLogLevel('warn');

// Set to show all logs (including debug)
window.logger?.setLogLevel('debug');

// Set to show info and above (default for production)
window.logger?.setLogLevel('info');

// Set to show only errors
window.logger?.setLogLevel('error');
```

### Log Categories

Logs are categorized by component:

- **ApiService**: HTTP requests and responses
- **StorageService**: Data persistence operations
- **ErrorHandler**: Error management and reporting
- **UI Components**: User interface interactions
- **App**: Application lifecycle events

### Examples

```
// API Request log
2025-07-31T14:39:44.173Z [INFO] [ApiService]: API Request {"method":"GET","url":"https://api.example.com/data","statusCode":200,"responseTime":145}

// Storage operation log
2025-07-31T14:39:44.186Z [DEBUG] [StorageService]: Saving groups {"action":"saveGroups","count":3}

// Error log
2025-07-31T14:39:44.204Z [ERROR] [ErrorHandler]: Network request failed {"errorType":"NETWORK_ERROR","url":"https://api.example.com/data"}

### Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command:

```
npm start
```

### Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, use:

```
npm run build
```

## Packaging and Running as a Native macOS App (.app)

You can generate a native `.app` file for macOS using [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/):

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode command line tools installed
- Node.js and npm

### Build Steps

1. Open a terminal and move to the project directory:
   ```
   cd curlino
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if not already done):
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the production bundle:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
4. Generate the `.app` and `.dmg` files:

   ```
   npm run dist
   ```

   or directly:

   ```
   npx electron-builder --mac
   ```

5. The `.app` file will be available in the `dist/mac/` folder. You can double-click it to launch Curlino as a native macOS application. The `.dmg` file can be used for easy distribution.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- Use the sidebar to navigate between groups and environments.
- Create new requests in the Request Panel.
- View responses in the Response Panel.
- Switch between requests using the Tab System.
